# Cribbage Board Collection - Easy Installation

## One-Click Installation (Recommended)

**For the easiest installation experience:**

1. **Double-click `EASY_INSTALL.bat`**
2. Wait for installation to complete
3. Look for the "Cribbage Board Collection" shortcut on your desktop
4. Double-click the desktop shortcut to start the application

That's it! The installer will:
- ✅ Check if Python is installed (install it if not)
- ✅ Set up the application automatically
- ✅ Install all required packages
- ✅ Create a desktop shortcut
- ✅ Handle everything silently

## What the Installation Does

- Downloads and installs Python 3.11 if needed
- Creates a virtual environment for the application
- Installs all required Python packages
- Sets up the database and file structure
- Creates a desktop shortcut for easy access

## Starting the Application

After installation, you have two ways to start:

1. **Desktop Shortcut** (Recommended): Double-click "Cribbage Board Collection" on your desktop
2. **Manual**: Double-click `run_cribbage.bat` in the application folder

The application will automatically:
- Start the server
- Open your web browser to http://localhost:5000

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Right-click `EASY_INSTALL.bat` and select "Run as administrator"**
2. Make sure you have an internet connection (needed to download Python and packages)
3. Check that Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking the installation

## Alternative Installation Methods

If the easy installer doesn't work:

- Try the more detailed `ONE_CLICK_INSTALL.bat`
- Use the original `INSTALL_EVERYTHING.bat` for maximum compatibility
- Run `python install.py` if you already have Python installed

## System Requirements

- Windows 7 or later
- Internet connection (for initial setup)
- At least 100MB free disk space
