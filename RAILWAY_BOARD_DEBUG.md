# Railway Board Image Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Local Testing Results
All board functionality works locally:
- ✅ Board creation, edit, delete routes working
- ✅ JavaScript delete confirmation working  
- ✅ Template URLs correctly using `url_for('uploaded_file', filename=...)`
- ✅ Database operations successful

## 🔧 Fixed Issues
1. **Delete Button**: Fixed POST method issue in JavaScript
2. **Image URLs**: All templates now use correct `uploaded_file` route
3. **Database Auto-initialization**: PostgreSQL tables created on startup
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for all operations

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Code
Deploy the latest code with all fixes applied.

### Step 2: Check File System Status
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/debug/filesystem`

This will show:
- Upload directory path and existence
- Directory permissions
- Current files in upload folder
- Write test results

### Step 3: Test Board Operations

**Add New Board:**
1. Go to your Railway app
2. Click "Add Board"  
3. Fill form with photos
4. Check Railway logs for upload debugging
5. Check if images display on board detail page

**Edit Existing Board:**
1. Click any board to view details
2. Click "Edit" button (should go to `/board/ID/edit`)
3. Check if existing images display
4. Try uploading new images

**Delete Board:**
1. From board detail page, click "Delete"
2. Confirm deletion in popup
3. Should redirect to main page

### Step 4: Diagnose Image Issues

**If images don't display:**
1. Check Railway logs for upload errors
2. Visit `/debug/filesystem` to see uploaded files
3. Try accessing image directly: `https://your-app.railway.app/uploads/filename.jpg`

**Common Railway Image Issues:**
- Files uploaded to `/tmp/uploads` but served from wrong path
- Permission issues with `/tmp` directory
- Files lost due to Railway container restarts
- Network issues preventing file access

### Step 5: Debug Output Analysis

**Successful Upload Logs:**
```
🖼️ Processing front image: board.jpg
📁 Upload folder: /tmp/uploads
📁 Upload folder exists: true
📝 Upload folder writable: true
💾 Saving to: /tmp/uploads/front_123_board.jpg
✅ Front image saved successfully
📊 File size: 245760 bytes
```

**File Serving Logs:**
```
🖼️ Serving file request: front_123_board.jpg
📁 Upload folder: /tmp/uploads
📂 Files in upload directory: ['front_123_board.jpg']
📄 File exists: true
```

**Problem Indicators:**
- "Upload folder exists: false"
- "Upload folder writable: false"  
- "File exists after save: false"
- "Files in upload directory: []"

## 🔍 Specific Railway Issues

### Issue: Images Upload But Don't Display
**Cause**: Template using wrong URL
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - All templates now use `url_for('uploaded_file')`

### Issue: Edit/Delete Buttons Don't Work  
**Cause**: JavaScript sending GET instead of POST for delete
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Delete now uses POST form submission

### Issue: Files Upload But Disappear
**Cause**: Railway containers restart and lose `/tmp` files
**Solution**: This is expected Railway behavior - files in `/tmp` are ephemeral

### Issue: Permission Denied on Upload
**Cause**: `/tmp/uploads` directory permissions
**Solution**: Code now ensures directory creation with proper permissions

## 📊 Next Steps
1. Deploy updated code to Railway
2. Test with NEW board/image uploads (don't rely on old data)
3. Check `/debug/filesystem` route for file system status
4. Report specific error messages from Railway logs

The local testing confirms all functionality works correctly. Any remaining issues are Railway-specific and will be visible in the debug output.
